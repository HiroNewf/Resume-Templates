# Resume-Templates
I have seen far to many people using terrible resume templates with too many column, too many colors, poor font choice, etc. I know that these templates here might look basic, but trust me simpler is better when it comes to resumes. A format like this is tried and true and its sure to help you improve your resume game. 

*Also I might have a full resume guide coming out soon shhh*

## My Templates
Here are three pretty solid resume templates that I threw together. They are all avaible in PDF and Docx form.

## Decent Flow.cv Templates

3. https://flowcv.com/resume-template/656707019a7513b79d90ccec
   * Remove all of the information under the degrees, for most people adding stuff like coursework, expertise, awards, etc is not a good idea
