# Resume-Templates
I have seen far to many people using terrible resume templates with too many columns, too many colors, poor font choice, etc. I know that these templates here might look basic, but trust me simpler is better when it comes to resumes. A format like this is tried and true and its sure to help you improve your resume game. It should also be noted that these are templates for the sake of providing good formatting to you resume, they are not full on resume examples, random Lorem ipsum text is used to fill them large amounts of them in. I might or may not have a full resume guide in the works that will go more into depth about how to actually fill a template like this in, common mistakes to avoid when making a resume, etc. For now though, I hope these templates prove useful to you. 
## My Templates
With all of that said here are the three pretty solid resume templates that I threw together, and yes they are all one page long because that is how long your resume should be 99% of the time. 
### Template 1

### Template 2

### Template 3
I'm not in love with all the white space in this one, but that is probably in large part due to the lack of a Experience section. TBH this was probably the worst of the templates that I could have picked to demonstrate how to make a resume without any experience, but ah well, I might update it later... or not. Just know that this template will work just fine even if you add an experience section and the other two can also be used without any experience.
