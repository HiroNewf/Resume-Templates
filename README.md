# Resume-Templates
I have seen far to many people using terrible resume templates with too many column, too many colors, poor font choice, etc. I know that these templates here might look basic, but trust me simpler is better when it comes to resumes. A format like this is tried and true and its sure to help you improve your resume game. 

*Also I might have a full resume guide coming out soon shhh*
